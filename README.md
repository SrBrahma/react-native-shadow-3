## This is a placeholder package.

### I still haven't decided if I am going to create a new major for [react-native-shadow-2](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2) or to create a new package, as the shadow-2 uses react-native-svg and this one will use react-native-skia.

If I end up creating a new major for shadow-2, I will delete this package so anyone else may use this name.

React Native Shadows for iOS and Android. Uses [Skia](https://github.com/Shopify/react-native-skia).

[react-native-shadow-2](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2) successor.
